## 🚰 What Is an Emergency Water Shut Off Valve?

An emergency water shut off valve is the primary control point that stops the flow of water from the municipal or well supply into a structure. In residential settings, this valve is typically located:
- Near the point where the water line enters the home
- In a crawl space or utility area
- Adjacent to an exterior wall
- At or near the water meter

Valve placement varies based on construction era, lot layout, and whether the property is connected to a public system or a private well.
